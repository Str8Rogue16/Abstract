This is a quick MLH Hackathon Project testing my memory and creativity. Trying to use HTML/CSS/JS and working by myself in a 4 hour window. 
Struggled and didn't get as many functions in as I wanted but I am pretty happy with this multi-page, hidden login item that leaves with a joke. 

Will work on the intended functions more indepth as time allows in the future.
